while loop:
While loop is a fundamental control flow structure (or loop statement) in programming, enabling the execution of a block of code repeatedly as long as a specified condition remains true. Unlike the for loop, which is tailored for iterating a fixed number of times, the while loop excels in scenarios where the number of iterations is uncertain or dependent on dynamic conditions.
break-it can be used to break the loop whenever we want.
looping statements also known as iterative statements.
loop-run multiple times
pass-skip the statement(ignore)
break-terminate the loop
continue-skip the current iteration

function:

A function can return data as a result.

Reusability using import keyword.
