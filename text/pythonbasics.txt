Python
Python is an object oriented & High level & Scripting Language.
Python uses .py extension.
print - It  is a built in function in python which performs specific tasks.
print given value to the terminal.

Python Datatypes:
A data which is created and stored in an organized way to perform various operations on it is called Data Structure.

Datatypes:
int-integer
"str"-string
list
dict-Dictionary
Bool-Boolen (true(or)false)

To  store these datatypes we can create  variables.

def Keyword:
function are block of codes that can be executed more than once using reference name like print or input.
To declare a function we need to write def keyword.

Strings:
-String is a textual data within Quotes.

-We can follow positive indexing or negative indexing through Slicing Index.

-We can define multiline string with three single quotes or three double quotes.

-String has start index and end index.

-We can use  .  operator  to access those built-in functions that came with strings or methods.

Numerical Datatypes:

int
float
complex
Numerical Operations
+,-,*,/,//,%,**

abs - absolute function

It is used to convert negative function to  positive.

max-maximum value
min-minimum value

round-rounding of logically
 
Boolen:

bool
True
(or)
False

In python, any integer '0' is considered as a false value,an non-zero integer is considered as a true value.

A string is empty is considered as false.

A float like 0.0 is considered as false.

Tuple:
tpl
tpl  - tuple

A tuple can not be  modified.

Set:
set
Unordered list:

             A list whose order is not taken into consideration which means they are not index.you can not perform slicing in these set as well.

Mathematical Set operations:
       If they are duplicates in a set  they are removed.
       A set only store unique values,not duplicates.

SET OPERATIONS:

interrsection
difference
Symmetric_difference
union

decision control:

elif statement,
Comparision operatiors,
Joining Condition ,
Ternary operators

Joining Condition
And,or,not,in keywords

match case statement:
variables,functioncalls,even Conditions can be passed  to match statements and matching.
